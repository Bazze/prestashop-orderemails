prestashop-orderemails
======================

A PrestaShop module for dropshipping support.

# Disclaimer
This is an old PrestaShop module I did a couple of years ago. Maybe someone could find it useful. If I remember correctly it should be working for PrestaShop version 1.4.x through 1.5.3.x.

Feel free to do anything you want with this. MIT license.

## INSTALL
How to install the module:

1. Copy the folder "orderemails" to your modules directory.
2. Go to the Modules tab in your back office and click Install on this module.
3. Configure the module to fit your needs.

## UPDATE
How to update from v1.0, 1.1 and 1.2:

1. Uninstall the module in your back office.
2. Replace the old files with the new ones.
3. Refresh your back office modules page. The module should now show the new version.
4. Install the module.
